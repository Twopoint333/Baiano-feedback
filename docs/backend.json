    "reasoning": "Based on the requirements, a single collection `survey_responses` will be used to store all survey responses. This approach is suitable given the relatively simple data model and access patterns.  All data resides in a single collection, simplifying queries and management. The schema for each document within the `survey_responses` collection includes fields for user identification (name, phone), survey responses (conheceInstagram, avaliacaoGeral, atendimento, agilidade, burger, sugestao), and a creation timestamp (createdAt). This design achieves Authorization Independence because there are no nested collections or complex relationships requiring `get()` calls in security rules.  The application does not have roles or user-specific private data.  Since there are no user-specific roles or ownership considerations, path-based ownership is unnecessary, and segregation isn't required. The structure allows for listing all survey responses, which is acceptable given there are no restrictions in the prompt regarding who can view the data."
